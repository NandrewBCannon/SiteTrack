-- SiteTrack workspace and job-site access lockdown.
-- Run this in Supabase after the workforce and join-code SQL files.
-- This removes the original MVP-wide authenticated policies and makes job-site
-- access explicit: admins see all sites in a workspace, joined users only see
-- sites granted through site_members.
-- Per the security review rule: no client-side trust and no broad authenticated
-- table access. Workspace membership alone is not job-site membership.
-- Existing databases must run supabase/add_manager_role.sql once before this file.
